# Introducing SmolLlama - A Smaller Language Model 

- So, I trained a Llama a 130M architecture I coded from ground up to build a small instruct model, going through the below-mentioned stages from scratch.
- Trained on FineWeb dataset form HuggingFace consisting of 15 M texts (10BT snapshot) for a total of full 3 epochs

The three main stages are:

1) Pretraining
2) SFT (Instruction Tuning)
3) Reward Tuning for human-like responses (DPO)


 ### 1) Pretraining

#### Dataset

 - I used the [FineWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb?row=0) dataset from HuggingFace (10BT checkpoint) consisting of roughly 15M texts.

  1) Train dataset - 12 M texts
  2) Val dataset - 3M texts

- After tokenization (GPT2), a total of 186k batches (a full epoch) were formed for a batch size of 64 across 4x 4090s with 46k batches for each node.

#### Hardware Setup

 - Used DPP using Pytorch torchrun consisting of 4x GeForce RTX 4090s (24gb VRAM each) rented on runpod.io
 - The model is a 1.5GB in size but needs around 5 GB of VRAM when loaded in fp32 precision
---

#### Frameworks:
**Pytorch**


--- 

#### Epochs/Steps
- Iterations (train) = 45k

- Val iterations = every 1k
---

#### Losses
- Train loss - 3.96

- Val loss - 4.01

### Running 


#### Training a model

- Kindly hange 'device' to any of your available cuda gpus.

To run:

```python
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=gpu llama.py \   
    --epochs 10 \
    --block_size 256 \
    --batch_size 32 \
    --embeddings_dims 1024 \
    --no_of_heads 8 \
    --max_lr 3e-4 \
    --prompt "Once upon a time" \
    --max_length 100 \
    --temperature 0.8
```
--standalone - if all the gpu are on one server
--npro_per_node - number of gpus available and use the keyword gpu to use all

#### Inference on a model

```python 
python inference.py --prompt "Once upon a time" --max_length 100 --temperature 0.8 --repetition_penalty 1.5 
```
